        <h4>Hi. I am Shuk Ting Kwong.</h4>
        <p>
          I am a deaf person who came to the UK on a BNO visa from last October.
          In the past, I was very interested in coding because of my exposure to
          coding, which met many of my requirements, such as reducing errors and
          automation. Therefore, I hope that I can make a smooth transition to
          the UK and devote myself to the industry of developers. My visa can
          work and study without any sponsorship. My interests are learning and
          reading. Right now I'm going all in on a full stack developer.My
          favorite animal is a pig. Sometimes I watch piggy videos.
